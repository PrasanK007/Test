Java OOP Conceptual Questions(Answers only)

1. There is no default constructor defined

2. Vehicle Starting( reason : it is calling method without arguments)

3.  20 â€“ obj1 and obj2 refer to the same object 

4. NullPointerException
5. NullPointerException,

Animal constructor runs first, inside Animal(), speak() is called but speak()           is overridden in Dog, so Dog.speak() is executed. 
At that moment, sound is still null because Dog constructor has not initialized it yet.
So in place of sound.toUpperCase() it becomes null.toUpperCase() throws an NullPointerException
